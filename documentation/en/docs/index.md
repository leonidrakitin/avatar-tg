But seriously, the project uses your ChatGPT token to access the ChatGPT API and let you chat with ChatGPT directly in Telegram.

## Work example



## Privacy
See my last name in the domain? [I'm a developer](https://mark.struchkov.dev), [blogger](https://struchkov.dev/blog/ru/), and publicly active. I don't have the benefit of getting dirty under my own name. I assure you that your data is not transferred to third parties, even I do not know about your requests to ChatGPT. You can see for yourself by examining the code, it's opensource.

## Preparing

* You must have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). You can run the project both on the PC and on the server.
* You must [register a bot in Telegram](https://t.me/BotFather) and get an access token.
* You also need [ChatGPT access token](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
* You must know your telegramId. [You can find it out here.](https://t.me/myidbot).

## Docker Run

``` bash
docker run --name chatgpt-telegram-bot upagge/chatgpt-telegram-bot:develop \
    -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=  \
    -e TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=  \ # (1)!
    -e TELEGRAM_PERSON_ID=  \
    -e CHAT_GPT_TOKEN=
```

1. Specify a name with the ending bot here, not a public name.

### Telegram Proxy
If you have Telegram blocked, you can specify proxy settings to connect.

``` bash   
docker run --name chatgpt-telegram-bot upagge/chatgpt-telegram-bot:develop \
    -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=  \
    -e TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=  \
    -e TELEGRAM_PERSON_ID=  \
    -e CHAT_GPT_TOKEN=  \
    -e TELEGRAM_PROXY_ENABLE=true \
    -e TELEGRAM_PROXY_HOST= \
    -e TELEGRAM_PROXY_PORT= \
    -e TELEGRAM_PROXY_TYPE=SOCKS5 \ # (1)!
    -e TELEGRAM_PROXY_USERNAME= \ # (2)!
    -e TELEGRAM_PROXY_PASSWORD= # (2)!
```

1. Available options `SOCKS5`, `SOCKS4`, `HTTP`.
2. Optional. If there is no authorization, you can leave it blank.

## :heart:{ .heart } Support Develop

Sponsorship makes a project sustainable because it pays for the time of the maintainers of that project, a very scarce resource that is spent on developing new features, fixing bugs, improving stability, solving problems, and general support. The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.
