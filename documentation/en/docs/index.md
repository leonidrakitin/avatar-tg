But seriously, the project uses your ChatGPT token to access the ChatGPT API and let you chat with ChatGPT directly in Telegram.

## Features

See for yourself how easy and convenient it is to use ChatGPT in Telegram. It is better to see once than to hear 100 times.

### Commands

`/clear_context` - Clears the conversation context. In fact, it deletes the chat and creates a new one.

`/prompt your_question` - Allows you to ask a question outside the context of the main conversation.

## Privacy
See my last name in the domain? [I'm a developer](https://mark.struchkov.dev), [blogger](https://struchkov.dev/blog/ru/), and publicly active. I don't have the benefit of getting dirty under my own name. I assure you that your data is not transferred to third parties, even I do not know about your requests to ChatGPT. You can see for yourself by examining the code, it's opensource.

## :heart:{ .heart } Support Develop

Sponsorship makes a project sustainable because it pays for the time of the maintainers of that project, a very scarce resource that is spent on developing new features, fixing bugs, improving stability, solving problems, and general support. The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.
